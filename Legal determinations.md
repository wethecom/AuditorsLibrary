The Facts
Legal determinations

Legal determinations are usually made by individuals or entities with legal authority and expertise, such as judges, arbitrators, administrative agencies, and government officials.

Here are some examples of who can make legal determinations in different contexts:

-   In a criminal case, a judge or a jury can make legal determinations regarding the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
    
-   In a civil case, a judge can make legal determinations regarding liability, damages, and other legal issues.
    
-   In an administrative proceeding, an administrative law judge or a regulatory agency can make legal determinations regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations.
    
-   In a dispute resolution process such as arbitration or mediation, an arbitrator or a mediator can make legal determinations regarding the rights and obligations of the parties involved.
    
-   In the executive branch of government, government officials such as attorneys general, prosecutors, and agency heads can make legal determinations regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations.


**Police officers** generally do not have the legal authority to make formal legal determinations. Their role is to enforce the law and investigate potential violations, but they do not have the power to determine guilt or innocence or to impose legal consequences on their own.

If a police officer suspects that a crime has been committed, they may arrest the suspect and bring them before a judge, who will make a legal determination based on the evidence presented in court. Similarly, if a police officer issues a citation or ticket for a traffic violation, the determination of guilt or innocence will be made by a court, not the police officer.

# Lawful orders

Lawful orders can be given by individuals or entities with legal authority over the person or persons being ordered. Here are some examples of who can give lawful orders:

1.  Government officials: Officials in the executive branch of government, such as the President, governors, and mayors, can issue lawful orders that have the force of law. These orders can be used to implement policy, enforce laws, or respond to emergencies.
    
2.  Military personnel: Military officers can give lawful orders to subordinates, including orders related to training, operations, and deployment. Soldiers are required to follow these orders, as long as they are legal and within the scope of the officer's authority.
    
3.  Employers: Employers have the authority to give lawful orders to their employees, including instructions related to job duties, workplace safety, and company policies.
    
4.  Judges: Judges can issue lawful orders as part of their role in the legal system. For example, they can issue orders related to bail, sentencing, and the conduct of trials.
    

It's important to note that lawful orders must be consistent with applicable laws and regulations, and must not violate the rights of the individuals being ordered. If an order is unlawful or violates an individual's rights, it may be challenged or overturned in court.


## Police do not give lawful order

this is a <u>**due process violation</u>** and can be ended in court with simple objections




No, police officers cannot practice law in the sense of providing legal advice or representation to clients. While police officers are trained in the law and have knowledge of legal principles, their primary role is to enforce the law and maintain public safety.

Police officers can provide information to individuals about the law and their legal rights, but they cannot offer legal advice or represent individuals in court. Giving legal advice or representing someone in court requires a license to practice law, which police officers do not have.

However, police officers may work closely with lawyers and other legal professionals as part of their investigations and enforcement activities. They may also testify in court as witnesses in criminal cases, but they do so as fact witnesses rather than as legal representatives.
