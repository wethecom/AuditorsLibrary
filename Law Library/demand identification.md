The US Supreme Court case law that states police cannot demand identification without probable cause is known as Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada.

In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that, under certain circumstances, an officer may detain a person and request identification without violating the Fourth Amendment, as long as the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in criminal activity. The court found that, in this case, the Nevada statute requiring a person to disclose their name during a lawful detention is constitutional.
