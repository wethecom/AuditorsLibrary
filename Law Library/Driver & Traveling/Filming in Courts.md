In Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia (1980), the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial applies to criminal trials and that the press and public have a First Amendment right of access to criminal trials.

In Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court (1982), the court held that the First Amendment guarantees the press and public access to the pretrial proceedings of criminal cases.

In Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court (1984), the court held that the First Amendment guarantees the press and public a right of access to the preliminary hearing in a criminal case.

In Branzburg v. Hayes (1972), the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment does not give journalists a right to refuse to testify before a grand jury regarding criminal conduct they observed while gathering news.

These cases indicate that the First Amendment does give rights of access to the press and public to criminal proceedings and information, but it does not apply to crime scenes.
