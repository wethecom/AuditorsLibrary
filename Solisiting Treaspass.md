It is not legal for police to solicit a trespass of someone engaged in federally protected activities. The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly, and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. These rights are protected by the federal government and the police are bound by the Constitution to uphold these rights.  
  
Police officers are prohibited from using their authority to interfere with or inhibit a person's exercise of their First Amendment rights. This means that police officers cannot use their authority to encourage or solicit someone to commit a trespass against someone engaged in a federally protected activity, such as peaceful protest or picketing.  
  
It's also important to note that police officers have a duty to protect and maintain public safety while also ensuring that individuals' rights are respected. Police officers should not use their authority to silence or discourage free speech or peaceful assembly, and they should not act to interfere with or inhibit these activities unless there is a clear and immediate threat to public safety.  
  
In the event that a police officer is found to have solicited a trespass against someone engaging in a federally protected activity, they may be subject to disciplinary action, and may also be held liable for any damages caused by the trespass. It's also worth noting that the individual who committed the trespass may also be held liable for any damages caused by their actions.

Additionally, the officer would be acting under color of law and would be in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 242 and 1983.
