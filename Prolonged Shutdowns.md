When arguing against a prolonged shutdown of courts, it would be beneficial to refer to cases and legal principles that emphasize the importance of timely justice and the protection of individual rights. Here are some cases and doctrines that might be pertinent:

### 1. Barker v. Wingo (1972)
This case established a four-factor test to determine whether a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial has been violated. The factors include the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion of their right, and prejudice to the defendant.

### 2. Bearden v. Georgia (1983)
While not directly related to court shutdowns, this case emphasized the principle of procedural due process, which requires fairness in government proceedings. A prolonged shutdown could potentially be seen as a violation of procedural due process.

### 3. United States v. $8,850 (1983)
In this case, the Supreme Court held that a 18-month delay between the seizure of property and the initiation of forfeiture proceedings violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. This case might be used to argue that long delays in court proceedings can violate constitutional rights.

### 4. Strunk v. United States (1973)
This case held that the only remedy for a violation of the right to a speedy trial is the dismissal of the indictment. It might be cited to argue for the dismissal of cases that have been delayed due to a court shutdown.

### 5. Doggett v. United States (1992)
In this case, the Supreme Court emphasized that excessive delay in prosecution could violate the Sixth Amendment even if the defendant could not demonstrate that the delay had prejudiced their defense.

### 6. State Cases and Precedents
Apart from federal cases, there might be state cases and precedents that emphasize the importance of timely justice and could be used to argue against prolonged court shutdowns.

### 7. International Human Rights Law
Depending on the jurisdiction, international human rights law, which often emphasizes the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time, might be invoked to argue against prolonged court shutdowns.

### Conclusion
When arguing against a prolonged shutdown of courts, it would be beneficial to focus on cases and legal principles that emphasize the right to a speedy trial and procedural due process. It would be a complex argument, balancing the individual's right to timely justice against the government's interest in protecting public health during a pandemic. It would be a matter of applying established legal principles to unprecedented circumstances.
