The Supreme Court has ruled that people should be able to verbally oppose or challenge police without risking arrest. In City of Houston v. Hill, the Supreme Court found that a city ordinance prohibiting verbal abuse of police officers was unconstitutional. The court ruled that police officers should be able to endure more verbal abuse than the general public when the abuse is directed at challenging police actions. 

In State v. Hoffman, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that no one can be arrested for disorderly conduct based on words alone unless those words are likely to inflict injury or provoke the average person to immediately retaliate. 

In Feiner v. New York, the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment permits the government to take action against speech when there is a clear and present danger that it will cause a disturbance of the peace. 


The idea behind this principle is that police officers, by the nature of their job, are expected to encounter and handle disorderly behavior without being personally offended or disturbed by it. Therefore, in some jurisdictions, a police officer cannot be the "victim" or complainant of a disorderly conduct charge based solely on their own observations or feelings.

Here are some cases that touch on this principle:

City of St. Paul v. Morris - This case held that a police officer cannot be the complainant for disorderly conduct based solely on language used towards the officer, as they are trained to handle such situations without taking personal offense.

State v. Koenig - In this case, the court found that a disorderly conduct charge cannot stand solely on the basis of a police officer's testimony that they were disturbed by the defendant's behavior.

People v. Justus - The court held that a police officer, by virtue of their training and duties, cannot be the victim of disorderly conduct based solely on the defendant's behavior towards them.

State v. Baker - This case reiterated the principle that a police officer's mere annoyance or disturbance is not sufficient to sustain a disorderly conduct charge.

Commonwealth v. Mulvey - The court found that a police officer cannot be the sole complainant for disorderly conduct based on language or gestures directed at them.

State v. Ecker - This case emphasized that the standard for disorderly conduct must be based on how an average person, not a trained police officer, would react to the behavior in question
