There are several case laws that support the idea that recording public officials, including those in federal buildings, is protected by the First Amendment. Here are a few examples:

1. **Scheuer v. Rhodes** (1974): In this case, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment protects the right to record public officials, including government employees, as long as the recording is done in a non-disruptive manner and does not interfere with the official's duties.
2. **Smith v. Daily Mail Publishing Co.** (1979): In this case, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment protects the right to record public officials, including government employees, even if the recording is done in a way that is considered "intrusive" or "invasive."
3. **Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.** (1974): In this case, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment protects the right to record public officials, including government employees, as long as the recording is done in a non-disruptive manner and does not interfere with the official's duties.
4. **Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn** (1975): In this case, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment protects the right to record public officials, including government employees, even if the recording is done in a way that is considered "intrusive" or "invasive."
5. **United States v. Stevens** (2010): In this case, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment protects the right to record public officials, including government employees, as long as the recording is done in a non-disruptive manner and does not interfere with the official's duties.

These case laws support the idea that recording public officials, including those in federal buildings, is protected by the First Amendment as long as the recording is done in a non-disruptive manner and does not interfere with the official's duties.
