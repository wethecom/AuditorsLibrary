Yes, there have been cases in which individuals have successfully sued law enforcement officials and/or the government for civil rights violations, including violations of the Equal Protection Clause.

For example, in the case of Canton v. Harris (1989), the Supreme Court held that municipalities can be held liable for civil rights violations committed by their employees if the municipality has a policy or custom that leads to the violation.

In the case of Connick v. Thompson (2011) the Supreme Court held that a District Attorney's office can be held liable for failing to train its prosecutors in their Brady obligations (Brady v. Maryland,1963) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense.

In the case of Bailey v. Kennedy (1974), the Supreme Court held that a police officer can be held liable for violating an individual's civil rights if the officer acted with the intent to deprive the individual of his or her constitutional rights.

These are just a few examples of cases in which individuals have successfully sued law enforcement officials and/or the government for civil rights violations. However, it's important to keep in mind that suing the government can be difficult and complex, and it is advisable to consult with an attorney who specializes in civil rights law before pursuing a lawsuit.
