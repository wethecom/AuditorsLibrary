The **Equal Protection Clause** is part of the first section of the [Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"). The clause, which took effect in 1868, provides "_nor shall any State ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws._" It mandates that individuals in similar situations be treated equally by the law.

Equal Protection refers to **the idea that a governmental body may not deny people equal protection of its governing laws**. The governing body state must treat an individual in the same manner as others in similar conditions and circumstances.
