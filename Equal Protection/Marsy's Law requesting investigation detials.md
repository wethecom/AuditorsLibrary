Pursuant to Marsy's Law, [insert state statute], I am requesting access to and copies of all records related to the investigation into my claim of a crime against me by a police officer [insert name and badge number of officer, if known], that occurred on [insert date of incident].

This request includes, but is not limited to, any and all investigative reports, witness statements, video or audio recordings, and any other relevant documentation or evidence collected during the course of the investigation.

As a crime victim, I am entitled to certain rights under Marsy's Law, including the right to be informed of the progress of the investigation, the right to be notified of any court proceedings related to the case, and the right to be heard at any such proceedings. I request that all information provided to me be kept confidential to the fullest extent possible to protect my safety and privacy.

Please let me know the estimated time frame of when the investigation will be completed and what the cost of obtaining the requested documents would be. If any of the information is exempt from release, please let me know which exemptions apply and the specific reasons why they apply.

Thank you for your time and assistance in this matter.

Sincerely, [Your name]

It is important to note that Marsy's Law is not a federal law, but a state law and it is being implemented in different states with different variations, therefore, it's important to check the specific wording of the statute in the state you are requesting the information from. Additionally, some agencies may have their own specific forms to submit a request under Marsy's Law, and it is a good idea to check if the agency has one before submitting the request.
