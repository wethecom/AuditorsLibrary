 Marsy's LawÂ **ensures that victims of crime have equal, constitutional rights on the same level as those accused and convicted of crimes**.

Marsy's Law is a term used to refer to a set of victims' rights amendments that have been proposed or enacted in various states in the United States. The laws are named after Marsalee "Marsy" Nicholas, a college student who was stalked and murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 1983. Marsy's Law is designed to give victims of crime certain rights and protections, such as the right to be notified of court proceedings and the release of the accused, the right to be heard at sentencing and parole hearings, and the right to restitution.

The laws vary by state, but they generally include the following rights for victims:

-   The right to be informed of the accused's release or escape
-   The right to be present at all court proceedings
-   The right to be heard at plea and sentencing proceedings
-   The right to restitution
-   The right to be notified of the accused's release or escape
-   The right to protection from the accused

Some states have enacted Marsy's Law as a state constitutional amendment, while others have passed it as state legislation. The law is still in its early stages and not all states have adopted it yet.
