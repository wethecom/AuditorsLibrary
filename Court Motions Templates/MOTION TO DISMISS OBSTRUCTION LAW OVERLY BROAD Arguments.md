Most obstruction of justice laws have been deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court because they are often too broad and vague, and can be applied in ways that restrict or punish protected First Amendment activities such as freedom of speech and the right to protest. Additionally, some laws have been deemed unconstitutional because they criminalize conduct that is not inherently wrongful, and because they allow for too much discretion on the part of law enforcement officials and prosecutors in determining when and how to charge someone with obstruction of justice.

The Supreme Court has held that laws that criminalize conduct that is not inherently wrongful, or that provide for too much discretion in the application of the law, are unconstitutional because they pose a risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, and because they restrict rights protected by the Constitution. Furthermore, the court has held that laws that criminalize speech or conduct that is protected by the First Amendment must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest and must not unduly burden protected speech or conduct.

It is important to note that while some laws have been deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, obstruction of justice laws in general have not been deemed unconstitutional, but laws that are too broad, vague, or have a potential for abuse are found unconstitutional by the court.
