COMES NOW the defendant, [Name], and moves this Honorable Court to dismiss the charges against the defendant on the grounds that the law criminalizing resisting, delaying, or obstructing a public officer in the discharge of their official duties is unconstitutional and therefore cannot be used as a basis for prosecution in this case.

The defendant argues that the law is overly broad and vague, and criminalizes conduct that may not necessarily be inherently wrongful, such as peaceful resistance to an officer's actions. Furthermore, the law allows for too much discretion on the part of law enforcement officials and prosecutors in determining when and how to charge someone with obstruction of justice.

The defendant cites the Supreme Court case of Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104 (1972), in which the Court held that laws that criminalize conduct that is not inherently wrongful, or that provide for too much discretion in the application of the law, are unconstitutional because they pose a risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.

The defendant also cites the Supreme Court case of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451 (1987), in which the Court held that laws that criminalize speech or conduct that is protected by the First Amendment must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest and must not unduly burden protected speech or conduct.

The defendant requests that the court review the constitutionality of the law in question and, if found unconstitutional, dismiss the charges against the defendant.

WHEREFORE, the defendant respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the defendant's motion to dismiss."

Respectfully submitted, [Name]
