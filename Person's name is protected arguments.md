Yes, the right to be secure in one's "persons, houses, papers, and effects" is protected by the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. This amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government and requires that the government have probable cause and a warrant in order to search or seize an individual's property.

While a person's name is not explicitly protected by the Fourth Amendment, it is often considered part of a person's "effects," which are protected from unreasonable searches and seizures. Additionally, the right to privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment has been interpreted by the courts to include a person's name and other identifying information, such as their address and telephone number.

So, in this sense, a person's name is protected as part of their person under the Fourth Amendment and the right to privacy.

is there any caselaw saying your name is protected?

Yes, there is caselaw that recognizes the protection of a person's name as part of their privacy rights. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that an individual's right to privacy includes the right to control the dissemination of information about themselves, including their name.

In the case of Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., 433 U.S. 562 (1977), the Court held that a performer's right to control the commercial use of his act included the right to control the broadcast of his name and likeness.

In other cases, the protection of a person's name has been recognized as part of their right to privacy under state law. For example, some states have laws that protect an individual's right to the exclusive use of their name and to prevent others from using their name for commercial purposes without their consent.

So, while the protection of a person's name is not explicitly stated in the U.S. Constitution, it is widely recognized as part of an individual's privacy rights and has been upheld by the courts in various cases.


any case law saying you have to give your name?

Yes, there are cases in which individuals are required to provide their name to the government under certain circumstances. The requirement to provide one's name can arise in the context of criminal investigations, law enforcement encounters, and other situations where the government needs to identify individuals.

For example, in Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada, 542 U.S. 177 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court held that an individual can be required to identify themselves to a police officer during a lawful detention.

However, it is important to note that the requirement to provide one's name is not absolute, and the government must have a legitimate reason for the request and must not infringe on an individual's constitutional rights. In some circumstances, individuals may assert their right against self-incrimination and refuse to provide their name to the government.

So, while individuals may be required to provide their name under certain circumstances, the requirement is subject to limits and protections established by the U.S. Constitution and other laws.

can the government make you give up a right without a jury trial?

No, the government cannot make you give up a constitutional right without a jury trial. The right to a jury trial is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which provides that "in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury." This right applies in both federal and state court proceedings and requires that a jury, not a judge, decide the facts of a criminal case.

The right to a jury trial is considered a cornerstone of the American criminal justice system and is considered an essential component of due process. It serves as a check on the power of the government and helps to ensure that an individual's rights are protected during a criminal prosecution.

In summary, the government cannot make you give up your right to a jury trial without a valid waiver or exception, as the right to a jury trial is a fundamental component of the U.S. Constitution and cannot be taken away without due process of law.


In the "Heredia v. California" case, the Court did make a statement that the state cannot diminish the rights of the people. This statement is consistent with the idea that individual constitutional rights are protected against infringement by the states and that the courts have a role in enforcing these rights.

And in Bennett v. Boggs, 1 Baldw 60, "Statutes that violate the plain and obvious principles of common right and common reason are null and void."

the case "Miller v. United States." The quote is often cited to support the idea that the exercise of a constitutional right cannot be criminalized by the government. The case involved a challenge to a federal law that made it a crime to refuse to answer questions posed by a congressional committee investigating the activities of communist organizations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the law violated the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination, as the government could not convert the exercise of a constitutional right into a crime.


"The claim and exercise of a constitutional right cannot thus be converted into a crime."  
[Miller v. U.S., 230 F.2d 486, at 489 (1956)]

". . .there can be no sanction or penalty imposed upon one because of his exercise of constitutional rights."  
[Sherar v. Cullen, 481 F.2d 946 (1973)]


Fifth Amendment that ‘No person shall be * * * deprived of * * * liberty * * * without due process of law’."
