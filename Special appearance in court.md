A special appearance in court is a limited appearance made by a party in a lawsuit who challenges the jurisdiction of the court over their person or property. The purpose of a special appearance is to contest the court's authority to hear the case or enforce a judgment against the party making the appearance.

In a special appearance, the party does not submit to the jurisdiction of the court for any other matter beyond the jurisdictional challenge. If the court finds that it does have jurisdiction, the party may then be required to fully participate in the case.

Special appearances can be made in various types of legal proceedings, including civil, criminal, and bankruptcy cases. They are often made by defendants who live in another state or have no significant connection to the state where the lawsuit was filed.

It's important to note that making a special appearance can be a complex legal issue and may require the assistance of a lawyer. Additionally, the rules and procedures for special appearances vary by jurisdiction, so it's essential to review the laws and court rules in your specific case.

A special appearance is a procedural device in which a defendant appears in court only to challenge the court's jurisdiction over them and not to respond to the substance of the claim. Here are the rules and caselaw about special appearances:

1.  Purpose: The purpose of a special appearance is to contest the jurisdiction of the court over the defendant and not to defend the case on its merits.
    
2.  Limited scope: A special appearance is limited to a challenge to the court's jurisdiction over the defendant and does not include any other defenses or objections to the case.
    
3.  Burden of proof: The defendant has the burden of proving that the court lacks jurisdiction over them.
    
4.  Timing: A special appearance must be made at the earliest opportunity, typically at the first hearing in the case or before entering a plea.
    
5.  Waiver: By making a general appearance, such as entering a plea or defending the case on its merits, the defendant waives their right to challenge the court's jurisdiction.
    
6.  Case law: In the landmark case of International Shoe Co. v. Washington, the US Supreme Court established the modern standard for personal jurisdiction, which has been widely adopted by other courts.

why?
A defendant may choose to make a special appearance instead of a general appearance for several reasons, including:

1.  Jurisdiction challenge: A special appearance is used to contest the court's jurisdiction over the defendant and not to respond to the substance of the claim.
    
2.  Waiver avoidance: By making a general appearance, such as entering a plea or defending the case on its merits, the defendant waives their right to challenge the court's jurisdiction. A special appearance allows the defendant to preserve their right to contest jurisdiction.
    
3.  Venue challenge: A special appearance may also be used to contest the venue, or location, of the case.
    
4.  Limited involvement: A special appearance limits the defendant's involvement in the case to the jurisdictional challenge and does not require them to defend the case on its merits.
    
5.  Jurisdiction risk: In some cases, a defendant may be uncertain about the court's jurisdiction over them and make a special appearance to determine whether they are subject to the court's jurisdiction before defending the case on its merits.
    

Ultimately, the decision to make a special appearance versus a general appearance depends on the specific circumstances of each case and the defendant's legal strategy.

_The act of presenting oneself in a court and thereby submitting to the court's jurisdiction, but only for a specific purpose and not for all the purposes for which a lawsuit is brought._

A party makes a special appearance before a state court for the sole purpose of objecting to the court's jurisdiction over that party. If the party makes a general appearance to respond to the lawsuit, instead of a special appearance, then **[COMMON LAW](https://law.jrank.org/pages/5444/Common-Law.html)** dictates that the party thereby waives any objection to the court's jurisdiction over her. A party may object to the court's jurisdiction for a number of reasons, such as when **[SERVICE OF PROCESS](https://law.jrank.org/pages/10171/Service-Process.html)** was insufficient or defective, there is a variance between the complaint and the summons, or the lawsuit was brought in the wrong court. When a party wants to make a jurisdictional objection, she has the right to appear for the special purpose of making that objection, but according to common law, the party must clearly and specifically state to the court that she is specially appearing.

Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure has abolished the distinction between general and special appearances for federal courts. Therefore, parties can raise a jurisdictional objection along with other defenses in a responsive pleading in federal court. However, if a party wishes to make the jurisdictional objection initially without having to prepare a full responsive **[PLEADING](https://law.jrank.org/pages/9232/Pleading.html)**, the federal courts will permit that party to do so if he specially appears.

Some states have followed the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and have eliminated for state court matters the distinction between general and special appearances. Many states still acknowledge the distinction, however, and some specifically provide for the distinction by statute.
