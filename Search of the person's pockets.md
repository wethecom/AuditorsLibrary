Terry v. Ohio was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that was decided in 1968. The case centered around a police officer's stop and frisk of a man named John W. Terry, who the officer suspected of casing a store for a potential robbery. The central issue in the case was whether the officer's actions were constitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures.

The elements that were given to the jury in the Terry v. Ohio case were not applicable because the case did not go to trial before a jury. Instead, the case was decided by the Supreme Court, which issued a written opinion outlining its ruling.

In that opinion, the Court held that a police officer may stop and frisk a person if the officer has reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in criminal activity and is armed and dangerous. This is sometimes referred to as a "Terry stop."

**<u>The Court further elaborated that a frisk or pat-down search during a Terry stop is limited in scope to a search for weapons and does not allow for a full search of the person's pockets or belongings.**</u> Additionally, the Court held that the reasonableness of a Terry stop must be judged based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time of the stop.

Overall, the elements at issue in Terry v. Ohio related to the scope of police authority to conduct stops and searches in the interest of public safety and crime prevention.
