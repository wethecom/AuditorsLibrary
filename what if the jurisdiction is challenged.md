If a jurisdiction challenge is raised and there is no plaintiff or prosecutor to respond, the court will still have to consider the challenge and make a determination on its jurisdiction. The court may still proceed with the challenge even if the plaintiff or prosecutor is not present, as the issue of jurisdiction affects the court's authority to hear and decide the case.

In this situation, the court may consider the facts and evidence presented by the defendant and make a decision based on that information. The court may also consider other relevant laws and precedents to determine its jurisdiction.

If the court determines that it does not have jurisdiction, it will dismiss the case. If there is no one present to appeal the decision, the dismissal will typically be final.

It is important to note that in most jurisdictions, it is the responsibility of the party raising the challenge to prove that the court does not have jurisdiction. If the plaintiff or prosecutor is not present to respond to the challenge, it may be more difficult for the court to make a decision, but the court will still have to make a determination based on the available evidence and legal authority.
